# Learn Computer Vision Basics with OpenCV in Python

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. It was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

The library has more than 2500 optimised algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognise faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognise scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.

## What will I learn during this workshop

In this hands-on Beginners Machine Learning online workshop, you will develop your data processing skills to complex datasets such as images. These workshop series will gradually develop to include video processing, deep learning and more advance applications in computer vision.

During the workshop we will analyse and process images in a Jupyter notebook. We first will look at the properties of images and explore the different image processing commands. After we have learned the basics, we will go through some exercises identifying objects in images using edge detection techniques and contours.

## Questions you will answer in this workshop

## Learning Objectives

- How are images stored in computer and what colour channels are
- How to read in and save images for processing using command line options
- How to perform basic image operations such as cropping, masking and transformations
- How to detect objects in images
- How to perform image analysis

## Prequisites

While you won't need prior experience in computer vision, we will assume basic programming experience with Python and package/environment managers such as pip, conda or pipenv

For referesher on python programming we recommend the following free course:
- Python programming language: See [Udacity - Intro to Python](https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)

## Steps

This workshop consists of 6 lessons and 5 projects:

**LESSONS**

2. Basic Image Processing Techniques (Cropping, Masking, Geometric Transformations, Morphological Transformations)
3. Kernels, Smoothing and Blurring Images 
4. Image Gradients, Thresholding, Edge Detection 
5. Identifying Contours of objects in Images 
6. Histograms and Image Enhancements by Equalising

**PROJECTS**
1. Data Augmentation for a flower detector machine learning classifier
2. Detecting Xs and Os for a Tic Tac Toe mobile game app
3. Classifying Shapes in an image
4. Identifying portraits for a mobile portrait scanner app
5. Detecting images of licence plates taken at night in dark

## Flow

1. Clone this git repository using `git clone https://github.com/beginners-machine-learning-london/computer_vision_basics.git` or download the repo as a zip file to get started
2. Setup your development environment using conda or pipenv using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Listen to lectures then work your way through the notebooks in `notebooks` folder.
4. Complete the project notebooks in the `projects` folder after the workshop.
5. Join our [slack group](http://tiny.cc/joinbmlslack) to get access to this workshop's private channel so that you can ask questions and connect wth your classmates
6. Submit the github repo link to your completed projects on our [website](https://beginnersmachinelearning.com) for grading and a chance to earn a course certificate 

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Attempt to complete the projects by yourself using openCV documentation and googling online. If you get stuck and cannot progress any further, then take a look at the solutions in the `solutions` folder
